Note: My machine is running on 4 cores + hyperthreading, therefore my virtual machine has 8 cores.

Parallel Merge Sort

To compile, run ./_compile
That compiles the parallel program and the sequential version.
To run all 5 examples, call ./_run, the output files will be called temp#
To test with other data, call the program like this: ./main inputFile outputFile

'main' is the parallel merge sort
'sequentialmain' is the sequential version of the parallel merge sort (without the cilk commands)
The answer to the malloc question is in the file MallocMemoryQuestion.
